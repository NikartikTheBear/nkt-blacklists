# nkt-blacklistvehs
a very simple method to blacklist vehicles, peds, props and removing pickups

i saw all kind of methods with complicated enumerators but nothing simple so i made one myself for everyone to use, it may not be perfect but you're more than welcome to improve it.
just define your desired blacklist options and you're good to go!
